1.
GenomeMatcher::findRelatedGenomes() is not fully implemented.

2.
Each method satisfies the big-O requirements.

3.
Trie's find() method:
	create vector of ValueTypes called test
	if key is empty, returns test (base case)
	looping through all of m_root's children
		if first letter of key matches the child's label,
			call findHelper with inputs test, key, index of 1, exactMatchOnly, and that children pointer
	return test

GenomeMatcher's findGenoemsWithThidDNA() method:
	if fragment is shorter than minimumlength, return false
	if minimumLength is shorter than GenomeMatcher's minSearchLength, return false
	if exactMatchOnly is true
		cut off first letter of fragment
		find that part of fragment using find from Trie of DNAMatches and store the output
		going through each of the found DNAMatches
			find the Genome associated with each of the DNAMatch's genomeName
			extract length j from that DNAMatch's position from the found Genome, j going from minimumLength to fragment's length
			if the extract function returned true and you can find the result from extract in the fragment,
				store this DNAMatch's name and position into a new DNAMatch variable and store j as its length
				store this new DNAMatch variable into a vector
			if this new vector is empty, return false
			find the DNAMatch with the largest length member variable and store that into matches
	if exactMatchOnly is false
		same thing as when exactMatchOnly is false, but instead of "if the extract function returned true and you can find the result from extract in the fragment,", its "if extract function returns true and the result and fragment have only a maximum difference of one letter" 
			this is achieved using an equals helper function that i wrote
